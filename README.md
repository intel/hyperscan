# Hyperscan

Hyperscan is a high-performance multiple regex matching library. It follows the
regular expression syntax of the commonly-used libpcre library, but is a
standalone library with its own C API.

Hyperscan uses hybrid automata techniques to allow simultaneous matching of
large numbers (up to tens of thousands) of regular expressions and for the
matching of regular expressions across streams of data.

Hyperscan is typically used in a DPI library stack.

# Documentation

Information on building the Hyperscan library and using its API is available in
the [Developer Reference Guide](http://intel.github.io/hyperscan/dev-reference/).

# License

Hyperscan is licensed under the BSD License. See the LICENSE file in the
project repository.

# Versioning

The `master` branch on Github will always contain the most recent release of
Hyperscan. Each version released to `master` goes through QA and testing before
it is released; if you're a user, rather than a developer, this is the version
you should be using.

Further development towards the next release takes place on the `develop`
branch.

# Building hyperscan - Using vcpkg

You can download and install hyperscan using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) dependency manager:

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
    ./vcpkg integrate install
    ./vcpkg install hyperscan

The hyperscan port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.
