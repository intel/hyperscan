 * failure. The caller may inspect the values returned in this type to
 * determine the cause of failure.
 *
 * Common errors generated during the compile process include:
 *
 *    - *Invalid parameter*
 *
 *      An invalid argument was specified in the compile call.
 *
 *    - *Unrecognised flag*
 *
 *      An unrecognised value was passed in the flags argument.
 *
 *    - *Pattern matches empty buffer*
 *
 *      By default, Hyperscan only supports patterns that will *always*
 *      consume at least one byte of input. Patterns that do not have this
 *      property (such as `/(abc)?/`) will produce this error unless
 *      the @ref HS_FLAG_ALLOWEMPTY flag is supplied. Note that such
 *      patterns will produce a match for *every* byte when scanned.
 *
 *    - *Embedded anchors not supported*
 *
 *      Hyperscan only supports the use of anchor meta-characters (such as
 *      `^` and `$`) in patterns where they could *only* match
 *      at the start or end of a buffer. A pattern containing an embedded
 *      anchor, such as `/abc^def/`, can never match, as there is no
 *      way for `abc` to precede the start of the data stream.
 *
 *    - *Bounded repeat is too large*
 *
 *      The pattern contains a repeated construct with very large finite
 *      bounds.
 *
 *    - *Unsupported component type*
 *
 *      An unsupported PCRE construct was used in the pattern.
 *
 *    - *Unable to generate bytecode*
 *
 *      This error indicates that Hyperscan was unable to compile a pattern
 *      that is syntactically valid. The most common cause is a pattern that is
 *      very long and complex or contains a large repeated subpattern.
 *
 *    - *Unable to allocate memory*
 *
 *      The library was unable to allocate temporary storage used during
 *      compilation time.
 *
 *    - *Allocator returned misaligned memory*
 *
 *      The memory allocator (either malloc() or the allocator set with @ref
 *      hs_set_allocator()) did not correctly return memory suitably aligned
 *      for the largest representable data type on this platform.
 *
 *    - *Internal error*
 *
 *      An unexpected error occurred: if this error is reported, please contact
 *      the Hyperscan team with a description of the situation.

/**
 * The basic pure literal expression compiler.
 *
 * This is the function call with which a pure literal expression (not a
 * common regular expression) is compiled into a Hyperscan database which
 * can be passed to the runtime functions (such as @ref hs_scan(),
 * @ref hs_open_stream(), etc.)
 *
 * @param expression
 *      The NULL-terminated expression to parse. Note that this string must
 *      represent ONLY the pattern to be matched, with no delimiters or flags;
 *      any global flags should be specified with the @p flags argument. For
 *      example, the expression `/abc?def/i` should be compiled by providing
 *      `abc?def` as the @p expression, and @ref HS_FLAG_CASELESS as the @a
 *      flags. Meanwhile, the string content shall be fully parsed in a literal
 *      sense without any regular grammars. For example, the @p expression
 *      `abc?` simply means a char sequence of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `?`. The `?`
 *      here doesn't mean 0 or 1 quantifier under regular semantics.
 *
 * @param flags
 *      Flags which modify the behaviour of the expression. Multiple flags may
 *      be used by ORing them together. Compared to @ref hs_compile(), fewer
 *      valid values are provided:
 *       - HS_FLAG_CASELESS - Matching will be performed case-insensitively.
 *       - HS_FLAG_SINGLEMATCH - Only one match will be generated for the
 *                               expression per stream.
 *       - HS_FLAG_SOM_LEFTMOST - Report the leftmost start of match offset
 *                                when a match is found.
 *
 * @param len
 *      The length of the text content of the pure literal expression. As the
 *      text content indicated by @p expression is treated as single character
 *      one by one, the special terminating character `\0` should be allowed
 *      to appear in expression, and not treated as a terminator for a string.
 *      Thus, the end of a pure literal expression cannot be indicated by
 *      identifying `\0`, but by counting to the expression length.
 *
 * @param mode
 *      Compiler mode flags that affect the database as a whole. One of @ref
 *      HS_MODE_STREAM or @ref HS_MODE_BLOCK or @ref HS_MODE_VECTORED must be
 *      supplied, to select between the generation of a streaming, block or
 *      vectored database. In addition, other flags (beginning with HS_MODE_)
 *      may be supplied to enable specific features. See @ref HS_MODE_FLAG for
 *      more details.
 *
 * @param platform
 *      If not NULL, the platform structure is used to determine the target
 *      platform for the database. If NULL, a database suitable for running
 *      on the current host platform is produced.
 *
 * @param db
 *      On success, a pointer to the generated database will be returned in
 *      this parameter, or NULL on failure. The caller is responsible for
 *      deallocating the buffer using the @ref hs_free_database() function.
 *
 * @param error
 *      If the compile fails, a pointer to a @ref hs_compile_error_t will be
 *      returned, providing details of the error condition. The caller is
 *      responsible for deallocating the buffer using the @ref
 *      hs_free_compile_error() function.
